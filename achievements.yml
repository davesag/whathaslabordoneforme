  :what: Introduced a national levy to assist Queensland with reconstruction
  :benefit: |-
    We were all horrified by the recent floods in Brisbane and other Queensland towns,
    and sadened by the loss of life that resulted. We all pitched in to help (as Queensland
    failed to insure itself against the damage), because that's what mates do. Yo, way to go.

- :code: floodstandard
  :what: Standardised national definition of flood for insurance purposes
  :benefit: |-
    We all know insurance companies will do almost anything they can to avoid paying up.
    Flood damage in particular was loosely defined and inconsistent, which allowed
    many insurers to skip out on payments. The Government put a stop to that.

  :what: Created Tourism 2020
  :benefit: |-
    Australia's tourism sector has been hit hard by the rise in the dollar, triggered
    largely by the mining boom. Also much of our tourism infrastructure is aging. All
    that chince in rural B&Bs springs to mind. Tourism 2020 assists tourism businesses
    to remain competitive into the future. If it could convince hotels to offer free wifi
    too, that'd help.
