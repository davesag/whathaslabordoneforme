- :code: queenslandrecovery
  :what: Introduced a national levy to assist Queensland with reconstruction
  :benefit: |-
    We were all horrified by the recent floods in Brisbane and other Queensland towns,
    and saddened by the loss of life that resulted. We all pitched in to help (as Queensland
    failed to insure itself against the damage), because that's what mates do. Yo, way to go.
  :url: http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/rebuilding-after-floods
- :code: floodstandard
  :what: Standardised national definition of flood for insurance purposes
  :benefit: |-
    We all know insurance companies will do almost anything they can to avoid paying up.
    Flood damage in particular was loosely defined and inconsistent, which allowed
    many insurers to skip out on payments. The Government put a stop to that.

- :code: tourism2020
  :what: Created Tourism 2020
  :benefit: |-
    Australia's tourism sector has been hit hard by the rise in the dollar, triggered
    largely by the mining boom. Also much of our tourism infrastructure is aging. All
    that chintz in rural B&Bs springs to mind. Tourism 2020 assists tourism businesses
    to remain competitive into the future. If it could convince hotels to offer free wifi
    too, that'd help.

  :what: Completed Australia’s first feasibility study on high speed rail
  :benefit: |-
    Europe, Russia, Asia, Africa, Latin America and the USA all have comprehensive rail
    networks, so why don't we? The Government finally decided to take a look at this,
    and who knows, maybe in 20 years or so, I can get a train to Sydney that doesn't suck.

- :code: ESCAS
  :what: |-
    Established the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance Scheme to provide traceability
    and accountability for live animal exports
  :benefit: |-
    We all saw that Four Corners episode that brought home the horrors of the live
    animal export market. The Government responded by making it harder for unethical
    animal exporters to allow such cruelty to go on. Why? Because it was the right thing
    to do.

  :what: Established a Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse
  :benefit: |-
    Some of our most vulnerable citizens have had their lives shattered by the very people
    they were supposed to be able to trust, and then the churches, and other institutions
    conspired to cover it all up. The Royal Commission will investigate where systems
    have failed to protect children, and make recommendations on how to improve laws,
    policies and practices to prevent, and better respond to child sexual abuse in institutions.

  :benefit: |-
    The Government has put in place a series of major reforms to build a stronger,
    fairer, and simpler tax system that we all benefit from.
  :url: http://www.futuretax.gov.au
- :code: taxfreethresh
  :what: Raised the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200
  :benefit: |-
    This means if you earn less than $18,200 in a financial year, you do not need to pay
    income tax. If you earn more than $18,200 in a financial year, you will only pay
    income tax on your earnings over $18,200.
    Paradoxically this saves the Government millions too
    due to not having to process over a million small tax returns.

- :code: aaarating
  :what: For the first time ever Australia has three triple A credit ratings from all three credit agencies
  :benefit: |-
    A better rating means investment is more secure and our money is thus cheaper. Interest
    rates are lower, and our purchasing power is enhanced. It's also another sign of just
    how well our economy has been managed by the Government.

  :what: Record long-term low inflation rate
  :benefit: |-
    In Australia, the inflation rate measures a
    broad rise or fall in prices that consumers pay for a standard basket of goods.
    Historically, from 1951 until 2013, Australia Inflation Rate averaged 5.28%
    reaching an all time high of 23.90% in December of 1951.

  :what: Lowest interest rates in 60 years with the average mortgagee paying $5,000 less p.a. than in 2007

    Historically, from 1990 until 2013, Australia Interest Rate averaged 5.44%
    reaching an all time high of 17.5% in January 1990.
    This means it's easier for businesses to borrow to invest,

    and the economy as a whole benefits.

- :code: lowdebtoedc
  :what: Lowest debt to GDP ratio in the OECD
  :benefit: |-
    While money is cheap it makes sense to have debt, but a lower debt ratio leaves us
    better positioned the next time our public debt needs to go up. By borrowing when money
    was cheap, and funding a range of econimic stimulus packages, the Government avoided
    the global economic crisis that ravaged much of the rest of the world.

  :what: Overseen the largest fiscal tightening in Australia's history (4.4%)

    The Government has remained comitted to reigning in expenditure, even during these

    When overseas money floods in there's more of it for us to use. We love foreign money,
    even though we still don't seem to like foreigners themselves much. Can't blame the

    China is our biggest trading partner and the growth of its economy is strongly linked

    Prime Minister Gillard has shown women all over the country that the glass ceiling
